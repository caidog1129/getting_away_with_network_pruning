CPAIOR 2023 paper: [Getting away with more network pruning: From sparsity to geometry and linear regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07966)
 
**Training** folder contains the code for training neural networks with different dataset using shrinkbench for pruning.  
**Counting** folder contains the code for counting linear regions.  
**Bounding_accuracy** folder contains the code for bounding linear regions and using these upper bounds as a guidence for pruning to see an improve in the accuarcy.   

Detailed instructions are inside these folders.
